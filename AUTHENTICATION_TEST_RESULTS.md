## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug #1: Phone field unique index conflict
- **Issue:** MongoDB unique index on phone field didn't allow multiple null values
- **Fix:** Index already had `sparse:true` in schema, dropped and recreated index
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Bug #2: Wholesaler registration missing bank details
- **Issue:** RegisterData interface didn't include bankDetails field
- **Fix:** Added bankDetails to RegisterData interface and validation schema
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **Files Modified:**
  - `server/src/services/auth.service.ts`
  - `server/src/middleware/validation.middleware.ts`

### Bug #3: Password change always failing
- **Issue:** User.findById didn't select password field (select:false in schema)
- **Fix:** Added `.select('+password')` to query in changePassword controller
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED
- **File:** `server/src/controllers/user.controller.ts:112`

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Phase 2.2 (Authentication) is COMPLETE and WORKING**
2. ➡️ Ready to proceed to **Phase 2.3 (Product/Order/Payment routes)**
3. ➡️ RBAC middleware is implemented and can be applied to new routes
4. ➡️ Consider implementing:
   - Email verification flow
   - Password reset flow
   - OAuth Google/Facebook (documentation already created in `GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`)
   - Rate limiting on auth endpoints
   - 2FA for sensitive operations

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2.3:** Implement Product, Order, and Payment routes
2. Apply RBAC middleware to protect role-specific routes
3. Add more comprehensive error handling
4. Implement email verification and password reset flows
5. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. Configure OAuth for production (Google/Facebook)
